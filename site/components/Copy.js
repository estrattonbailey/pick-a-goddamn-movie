          <h4>No seriously, what’s the point?</h4>
          <p>Ever behind on all-things entertainment,  Melanie and Eric waste hours browsing whatever content diarrhea is spewing across today’s streaming platforms.  And yet, on most evenings (after sifting through 2-27 trailers), the pitiful pair won’t wind up watching anything.</p>
          <p>Thus, the duo decided to create a new, fail-safe system. If they limit their options to a measly six movies, they, like, HAVE to select one. In other words, they are not allowed to watch ANY other movies than the chosen six.</p>
        </div>
        <div className='copy__right'>
          <h4>What are the parameters?</h4>
          <p>Both participants select a maximum of THREE movies to contribute to the selection pool. Anytime the two gather to watch a movie, they can only select a film from the established six. NO EXCEPTIONS.</p>
          <p>Participants may NOT switch a movie title after it has been submited. After a participant’s submission has been viewed, they may submit a new film to fill their open slot. Repeat submissions are permitted.</p>
          <p>If a single participant’s movie submissions have been selected three times in a row, the pair MUST choose from the other participant’s submissions.</p>

          <p>How long can a movie be? Please make it as long as possible. Only seven hours? No! Longer! Please!</p>
